                            As part of my groups comps/capstone project we each developed our own version of classic board games that can be played on Board Game Arena Studio by using their given studio files. The original project had underwent some changes as we underwent issues with the given tutorials and documentations as they were not up to date, but we managed to adapt and develop four games that <abbr title="Board Game Arena">BGA</abbr> had license for.

                            A project focused on developing a user interface for an app to be used on campus by  classmates in order to improve their time at Carleton by making it easier to manage their laundry and to know the availability of the laundry machines for their dorm. There were three prototypes made for the project with focus groups and interviews being done with students to better improve the prototypes and to better understand their needs. The final prototype was made using Figma to develop the interaction flow while making use of a UX research protocol with accessibility in mind of the design.
