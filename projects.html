            <h2>Carleton College Laundry App</h2>
            <p>Made by: Leo Moran, Ezra Barber, Julian Tanguma, Josh Meier</p>

            <p>Through my focus group, along with Julian's interview, I learned about the various functions that our users (Carleton College students within the dormitories) would want from the app. Some examples of what the user wants would consist of using their Carleton email as a means of logging on, using maps as an easier way of selecting dorms, and viewing the availability of all machines within a dormitory. The listed features are just a few features that were added to the prototype design of the app, all of which can be seen in Figure 1.
                When the user initially opens the app, they will be presented with a login screen that will require their Carleton email which is then checked with the Carleton accounts to make sure that the user is a student. While the email was initially meant as a means of not needing to remember another username, I believe that it can also be used as a form of authentication to prevent third parties from viewing the user’s laundry habits. 
                For selecting their default building, I offer the user the option to either type the name of the building, pick from a list of buildings, or select the building on the map as designated by a star. The subjects in my focus group mentioned how requiring the user to select from a list or to type the building name can prove difficult for freshmen who don’t know the names of the buildings yet. The reason why I use three different means of selecting a building is to allow users to go through with whichever method they are comfortable with. When a user selects a building through whatever means, not only with the star light up, but the name of the building will appear within the search bar, allowing the user to know if they picked the right building.
                Something that was mentioned between both my focus group and Julian’s interview is the importance of seeing the availability of all machines within a dormitory and if a machine is broken. To handle both needs, I have color-coordinated the machines according to their availability, if they are blue or red then they are in use (blue for washing machines, whereas red is for drying machines), if they are gray then they are free, if they are orange then they are broken. Furthermore, the times on each machine signify when they will be next available and can allow the user to plan when they head down to the laundry room.
                For the final feature of setting a dorm as the default, it was mentioned in Julian’s interview as a way of being able to immediately check the availability of your dorm without having to select it every time. The feature of setting of choosing your dorm is then part of the process when making your account, and can be changed when you view other buildings. By allowing the user to change their default building, it accounts for when they may need to move at the start of each school year.
