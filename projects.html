                            As part of my groups comps/capstone project we each developed our own version of classic board games that can be played on Board Game Arena Studio by using their given studio files. The original project had underwent some changes as we underwent issues with the given tutorials and documentations as they were not up to date, but we managed to adapt and develop four games that <abbr title="Board Game Arena">BGA</abbr> had license for.

                            A project focused on developing a user interface for an app to be used on campus by  classmates in order to improve their time at Carleton by making it easier to manage their laundry and to know the availability of the laundry machines for their dorm. There were three prototypes made for the project with focus groups and interviews being done with students to better improve the prototypes and to better understand their needs. The final prototype was made using Figma to develop the interaction flow while making use of a UX research protocol with accessibility in mind of the design.

                            During freshman year, for my intro to computer science class final project I decided to develop a game of snake while using Python for the game functions and matplotlib for the graphics. During development I had to modulate the code to make it easier to read through and to utilize functions more effectively.

                            As a part of my digital narratives class during my senior year, I made use of Ren'Py to develop a short murder mystery game that occurs within the birthday party of the main character. I used this game as an opportunity to learn how to use Blender to make 2D digital art and personally designed and wrote every chracter, scene, and evidence piece. To allow for replayability I made the starting choices decide who the new killer is and provided new assistents based on who died.
