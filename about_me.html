            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>Alright, enough formal talk, lets move onto something more 
                fun! Now sadly I cannot talk about my old dnd campaign 
                since I lost track of my notebook since the great upheaval 
                (when I moved into my college dorm) so my life story will 
                have to do.</p>
    
            <p>I come from a low income family with my mother coming from 
                the Dominican Republic, and my father from Salvador. They 
                met in the Big Apple (also known as New York) and thats 
                where they had me! But before I was born, they decided 
                that Vermont would be a better place to raise a family and 
                moved there, and its within these green hills that I was 
                born and raised, along with my two younger siblings. While 
                here, I was set into Kingstreet Youth Center during my 
                middle school years since my parents were divorced and my 
                mother was normally to busy at work to watch over my 
                siblings and I. While at this center I found my interest 
                in readings!... through a reading contest for an ipod as 
                the prize. Although I was only interested in reading so 
                that I can play games with an IPod, I continued reading as 
                I became invested in the stories and learned just how 
                entertaining good storytelling can be. Through my 
                interests in games and stories, I became more interested 
                in video games that told stories and hoped to develop some 
                so that I may also start creating my own stories, but in 
                order for me to do so I felt that I needed to understand 
                how to first create a video game. My parents had me join 
                in some activities to help jumpstart my learning such as 
                in Lego Camp where we learned to build not just Legos but 
                also software using Scratch. While working on Scratch, I 
                found the process of making the game to be fun and 
                enjoyed my time there. Next, they had me join the 
                Governor's Institutes of Vermont for one of their 
                programs that had me working with wires, coding, and how 
                to work with a Raspberry Pi. Although I was not able to 
                develop games, I still found myself enjoying the process 
                of designing and creating software and seeing it function 
                made it felt like magic to me. So when I took my first 
                computer science class in Milton High School, one could 
                say that I was one of the more enthusiastic students of 
                the class and what I had learned had only heightened my 
                excitement and solidified my desire to pursue a career in 
                computer science. I find that software development allows 
                me to tinker with my creations in a way that I cannot 
                replicate anywhere else, and allows my projects to come 
                to life.</p>
