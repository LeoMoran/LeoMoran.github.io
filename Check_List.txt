This file is a check list for changes needed to be implemented onto my website.

1. Make it so that my headshot doesn't grow to be so massive on the index page

2. Prevent the logos on the contact pages from being squeezed when changing the 
   page size, instead make it consistent like the headshot

3. Make error messages

4. Continue to add documentation for the files

5. Make the navigation bar look nicer

6. Make the links on the contacts page function

7. Have the colors be friendly to those who are color blind (make them consist of Blue and 
   Red while not having them grouped together)

8. Add a "skip to main content" link above the navigation bar

9. Add a "back to the top" link once the navigation bar is out of view

   - Your name

   - Your year in school

   - Your major(s) & if applicable, minor(s), either intended or declared

   - Any previous work experiences, professional accomplishments, or leadership roles you 
     want to highlight

   - If you are looking for an internship or job, a description of the kinds of internships 
     or jobs you are looking for (feel free to talk to Jean if you have questions about this). 
     If you already have an internship or job (congrats!), a brief description of the 
     internship or job. If you choose to include this information on your homepage, this 
     information should be within strong tags.

   - If your bio contains any abbreviations, they should be contained within abbreviation 
     tags.

- Your website’s homepage contains your headshot, if you don’t want a headshot or if another 
  image is better suited, an image related to any of the previous work experiences, 
  professional accomplishments, or leadership roles you highlighted. Your headshot or image 
  should include alt text.

  website itself (e.g. how my CV is linked on my homepage) or an external link (e.g. Google 
  drive).

- Your explanation of your design choices in the Google Doc identifies which users your 
  website prioritizes. Refer to the reading from the Usability Prep, Design Values: 
  Hard-Coding Liberation? (Section: Make Me Think: Differential Cognitive Load), for examples 
  of how websites prioritizes different users.

- Your description of your accessibility features in the Google Doc identifies which users 
  are served by those features.

- [For new websites developed in this class, not pre-existing personal websites] Any unused
