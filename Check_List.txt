This file is a check list for changes needed to be implemented onto my website.

1. Make it so that my headshot doesn't grow to be so massive on the index page

2. Prevent the logos on the contact pages from being squeezed when changing the 
   page size, instead make it consistent like the headshot

3. Make error messages

4. Continue to add documentation for the files

5. Make the navigation bar look nicer

6. Make the links on the contacts page function

7. Have the colors be friendly to those who are color blind (make them consist of Blue and 
   Red while not having them grouped together)
