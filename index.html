            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>My name is Leo Moran. I am a student from Carleton College 
                majoring in Computer Science and hope to find a career 
                within that field. I have worked for Saykid as a summer 
                intern and helped develop game designs and content that 
                would be installed into their ToyBots, which are meant to 
                entertain and educate children. Currently, I am working 
                for <abbr title="Information Technology Services">ITS</abbr> for the helpdesk at Carleton College and have been 
                helping faculty, staff, and students alike with their 
                technological issues either in person, on the phone, or 
                through chat messages. Some programing languages that I 
                have worked on in the past consist of Python, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, 
                Java, C, and Flask. I will be graduating in June of 2025 
                and currently live in Vermont, but I will be willing to 
                relocate if necessary. I hope to provide new perspectives 
                and innovative ideas to the projects that I participate in 
                and assist with the understanding of complex ideas.</p>
