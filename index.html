                        <h2>My Story</h2>

                        <p>Hi there!</p>
                        <p>My name is Leo Moran. I am a student from Carleton College 
                            majoring in Computer Science and hope to find a career 
                            within that field. I have worked for Saykid as a summer 
                            intern and helped develop game designs and content that 
                            would be installed into their ToyBots, which are meant to 
                            entertain and educate children. Currently, I am working 
                            for <abbr title="Information Technology Services">ITS</abbr> for the helpdesk at Carleton College and have been 
                            helping faculty, staff, and students alike with their 
                            technological issues either in person, on the phone, or 
                            through chat messages. Some programing languages that I 
                            have worked on in the past consist of Python, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, 
                            Java, C, and Flask. I will be graduating in June of 2025 
                            and currently live in Vermont, but I will be willing to 
                            relocate if necessary. I hope to provide new perspectives 
                            and innovative ideas to the projects that I participate in 
                            and assist with the understanding of complex ideas.</p>
